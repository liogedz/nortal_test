# AI Usage

## Extensively used as great learning tool!

- All changes I made are commented in service and repositories.
- Failure errors are taken from frontend file with constants [i18n.ts](/frontend/src/app/i18n.ts)
- In general, first I'm trying to compose code myself and then pass it to AI for confirmation.
- Generated `.gitignore` with AI for the first version, as it was absent.
- Was trying long time to fight with `intellij` to display DB in it just for reference (as I've done in my previous projects), even was trying to create db in file, not memory like
  it is now...AI advised that this actually not possible, as it is schema-based initialization.
- Almost all tasks were quite easy for me. Excepting a few bugs in initial project version ;). Still it was very interesting and exciting task - I have never done
  correction of the code before. I spent much time alone completing `kood/Jõhvi` Java FullStack specialization - some of them quite complicated. So it
  gave me good background completing this one.
- Borrow limit I knew straight away that need to implement new repository query, only asked AI how to implement in
  `gradle` setup (in `BookRepositopry`, `BookRepositoryAdapter` and `JpaBookRepository` ), as never worked with `gradle`
  b4. All tasks were requiring though proper thinking and action alignment.
- `Gradle` tests passed.
- Unfortunately erased first version (no history of my work is available) submitted on the 17th of December, due to mistake when have uploaded corrected version of the task.

- **_Thank you for Your time and attention!!!_**
